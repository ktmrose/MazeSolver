# MazeSolver
Solves mazes using breadth-first-search traversal, if a solution exists.  Takes in a maze as a .txt file (see example maze folder for format) and generates a new .txt file with the shortest path indicated with "." if it exists. If the maze is unsolvable, the solution text file will look identical to the input maze file.
